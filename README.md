# namesdecade-reader
OOP Fall 21 Quarter 2 Project - Reads names ranked throughout ten decades (1900 - 2000) in a  4.5K line text file and manipulates them through a hashMap and GUI using 8 total different methods.

The Names Class runs eight different methods manipulating the "names.txt" file. The first method finds all names that have been getting more popular each decade, and outputs the answer to a textarea component in the GUI. The second method displays the ranks from a user-given name in the textarea component within the GUI. The third method displays all the names that have only been ranked in one decade in the textarea component within the GUI. The fourth method displays all the names that have been ranked in all decades in the textarea component within the GUI. The fifth method displays all the names of a user-given rank in the textarea component within the GUI. The sixth method draws a graph of a user-given name's ranks throughout the decades, and displays it in a Canvas frame. The seventh method finds all names that have been getting less popular each decade, and outputs the answer to a textarea component in the GUI. The eighth method exits the program, terminating the program. 


The GUI class creates a GUI that holds a picture, textarea component, and eight different buttons that each run the eight methods from the Names Class, and displays the output on the textarea. 


The Start class runs the main method which creates a GUI object.
